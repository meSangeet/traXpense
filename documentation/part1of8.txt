3. cors -> CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and it allows a server to specify who can access its resources. It helps in handling cross-origin requests in a secure manner.

.role of .env file --> 

The .env file, short for "environment file," is a configuration file commonly used in software development. Its primary role is to store environment-specific configuration variables, such as API keys, database connection strings, or other sensitive information.

The code dotenv.config(); is typically used in Node.js applications with the dotenv library to load and parse the values from a .env file into environment variables.


const PORT = 8080 || process.env.PORT: This line assigns the value of 8080 to the PORT constant if process.env.PORT is not defined or evaluates to a falsy value. Otherwise, it assigns the value of process.env.PORT to the PORT constant. This allows flexibility in specifying the port number either through a hardcoded value (8080 in this case) or through an environment variable.
