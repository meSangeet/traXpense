user route 

const express = require('express'): Imports the Express framework, which is a popular framework for building web applications in Node.js.

const { loginController, registerController } = require('../controllers/userController'): Imports the loginController and registerController functions from a file located at '../controllers/userController'. These functions are expected to handle the logic for user login and registration operations.

const router = express.router(): Creates a router object using the express.router() method. This router object allows you to define routes for specific endpoints.

router.post('/login', loginController): Defines a route for the /login endpoint with the HTTP method POST. When a request is made to this endpoint, the loginController function will be executed to handle the request. This function is responsible for implementing the login logic.

router.post('/register', registerController): Defines a route for the /register endpoint with the HTTP method POST. When a request is made to this endpoint, the registerController function will be executed to handle the request. This function is responsible for implementing the user registration logic.

module.export = router: Exports the router object to make it available for other parts of the application.

















user and register controller ---



The provided code defines two controller functions, loginController and registerController, that handle the logic for user login and registration operations within a Node.js application. It also imports the userModel from a file located at '../models/userModel'.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

const userModel = require('../models/userModel'): Imports the userModel from a file located at '../models/userModel'. This model represents the schema and provides methods for interacting with the user data in the database.

const loginController = async (req, res) => { ... }: Defines the loginController function. This function is an asynchronous function that takes in two parameters: req (request) and res (response). It handles the logic for user login.

Inside the function:

const { email, password } = req.body: Destructures the email and password properties from the request body. These properties are expected to be sent in the request payload when making a login request.

const user = await userModel.findOne({ email, password }): Uses the userModel to find a user in the database whose email and password match the provided values. The findOne() method searches for a single document that matches the specified conditions.

if (!user) return res.status(400).send('user not found'): Checks if a user was found. If no matching user is found, it sends a response with a status of 400 (Bad Request) and a message indicating that the user was not found.

res.status(200).json({ success: true, user }): If a user is found, it sends a response with a status of 200 (OK) and a JSON object containing a success status and the user object.

const registerController = async (req, res) => { ... }: Defines the registerController function. This function is an asynchronous function that takes in two parameters: req (request) and res (response). It handles the logic for user registration.

Inside the function:

const newUser = new userModel(req.body): Creates a new instance of the userModel with the data from the request body. This assumes that the request body contains the necessary properties to create a new user.

await newUser.save(): Saves the newly created user to the database using the save() method provided by the userModel.

res.status(201).json({ success: true, newUser }): Sends a response with a status of 201 (Created) and a JSON object containing a success status and the newly created user object.

module.exports = { loginController, registerController }: Exports the loginController and registerController functions, making them available to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

In summary, the code defines controller functions for handling user login and registration. The loginController function searches for a user with the provided email and password and returns the user if found, while the registerController function creates and saves a new user to the database.
