CORS

It is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages scripts from making requests to a different
domain than the one that served the script.

Middleware

middleware refers to functions or components that sit between the initial processing of an HTTP request and the final 
delivery of the corresponding HTTP response. Middleware functions are responsible for processing and modifying the request
request and response objects, as well as controlling the flow of the applications.

const app = express(): This line creates an instance of the Express application. It initializes the server object that will handle HTTP requests and responses.

app.use(morgan('dev')): This line registers the Morgan middleware with the Express application. It configures Morgan to use the 'dev' format, which provides concise and colorful output for logging requests.

app.use(express.json()): This line registers the built-in Express middleware for parsing JSON. It allows the server to handle JSON-encoded data sent in the request body.

app.use(cors()): This line registers the CORS middleware with the Express application. It enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and allows requests from any origin.


We are building our application on the MVC pattern.

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a software design pattern commonly used in building applications, particularly web applications. It separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. Each component has a specific role and responsibility within the overall architecture.

Here's an explanation of each component in the MVC pattern:

Model:

The Model represents the application's data and business logic.
It encapsulates the data and provides methods for accessing and manipulating that data.
It is responsible for managing the application state and enforcing business rules.
In a web application, the Model often interacts with a database or external APIs to fetch or persist data.
View:

The View is responsible for presenting the data from the Model to the user.
It defines the visual representation of the application's user interface (UI).
It receives input from the user and sends it to the Controller for processing.
In a web application, the View is typically implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Controller:

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
It handles user input and initiates appropriate actions based on that input.
It receives input from the View, interacts with the Model to perform necessary operations, and updates the View with the updated data.
It contains the application's logic for processing requests, making decisions, and coordinating the flow of data between the Model and the View.
The MVC pattern promotes separation of concerns and modularity in application design. It allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability by keeping different aspects of the application separate. Changes in one component can be made without affecting the others, as long as the defined interfaces between the components are maintained.

In a web application context, the MVC pattern is often used with frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, or Laravel, where the framework provides the underlying structure and conventions to implement the MVC architecture. However, the MVC pattern can be applied to various types of applications, not just web applications.
